## Project Proposal

### Need for the App:

    Living with people can be difficult. Especially in college, when nobody has quite enough time to organize chores, make food, or pay the bills. There is a need for an app that can help housemates organize all things that come with living together, to take the burden and responsibility off of any one person while keeping all of those in the house responsible for their house duties.
    
    
### Target Audience:

    College students living in apartments or off-campus houses who need help organizing their living situations. 
    
### People and stakeholders: 

    Our Housemates are our primary stakeholders and supporters. Several of them have expressed a need/interest in our app, and we hope to continue consulting them as we build out our idea.
    
### Statements of support:

    One of Claudia’s housemates: “We usually struggle with making sure everyone is paid back for all of our bills and such, so having an app would be a nice way to make sure that we could actually coordinate that easily.”
    
Another one of Claudia’s housemates: “My floor of the house is not good at doing chores. If the app made that easier, I would definitely use it.”

### List and briefly describe the core functionality of the app, the most important functions and transactions of the app.

    The app will allow users to create groups of their housemates. Features include:
        * Chore wheel: users can enter a list of chores, and the app will split the chores between all the housemates. The app can also send reminders and set deadlines for the chores to be completed. 
        
        * Messaging: Housemates can post messages and receive responses within the app
        
        * Bills: For things like rent and utilities, users can post the amount one person paid, and the app will split the cost between all housemates, and keep track of how much each individual owes. 


### List and briefly describe the secondary functionality of the app, the functions and transactions of the app that are nice to have only if time allows.

* Calendar of upcoming events such as house gatherings/meetings, individuals hosting parties so that others will be notified, etc.

* Poll creation so that house matters revolving around gatherings/trips can be agreed upon. 

* When to Meet integration to create time slots that allow users to enter times they can meet for certain things

* Venmo integration for bill paying 

### List the features on a mobile device that the app will use (e.g., camera, GPS, SMS, flashlight).

* SMS - messaging amongst the people in the house

* Venmo integration

### Briefly describe any limitations each team member may feel that will hold back progress.

    We will be using ReactNative, and Sara and Johnny have never used it. We imagine there will be a bit of a learning curve, but are excited to learn and use a new technology. Claudia has developed in React before and is familiar with the technology so hopefully will be able to provide some knowledge about the structure of React. Another concern some of us have is simply learning all of the consideration we will have to make for mobile development that we do not have to navigate with other platforms.
